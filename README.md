Heroes of Pymoli


	In this project, I used pandas to create and manipulate data frames to explore the Heroes of Pymoli Data provided. Given my code, one could assess the differences in the user base and purchasing patterns of different genders and age groups.
	Based on the Gender demographics table, most of the player base, or at least the player base interested in microtransactions, is predominantly male. One would need to know the gender distribution of video game consumers in general to know whether 84% is high or low.  
	Most players were in the 20-24 age range, and this group was the largest source of revenue. The developer may be interested in targeting males aged 20-24 in their advertising and products. 
	The most popular items tended to also be the most expensive, and thus brought in the most revenue. This could be the case because items in the game could serve as status symbols for other players.
